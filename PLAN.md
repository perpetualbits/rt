## 1. Goal

`rt` is a *loose* Rust port of **Terminator** (the Python/GTK3 tiling terminal
emulator) that borrows **Alacritty's** architecture for speed. It is not a
line-by-line translation — it reimplements Terminator's *feature set* (infinite
tiling splits, tabs, layouts, grouped/broadcast input) on top of a fast,
Rust-native terminal engine.

### Design thesis
- **Terminator** gives us the *UX*: recursive split panes, tabs, saved layouts,
  input broadcast to groups, key-driven navigation.
- **Alacritty** gives us the *engine*: `alacritty_terminal` is a reusable crate
  providing the PTY, a damage-tracked grid, and a fast VTE/ANSI parser. Reusing
  it is the concrete meaning of "use ideas from alacritty to make it faster" —
  we get its performance work (damage tracking, batched parsing) for free
  instead of reimplementing GTK+VTE's slower widget model.

### Non-goals (for the first working version)
- Perfect config-file compatibility with Terminator's `~/.config/terminator/config`.
- Plugin API parity. Ligatures. Full GTK theming.

## 2. Architecture decision (ADR-0001)

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  rt  (winit window + wgpu/GL glyph renderer)                |
|                                                             |
|   +-----------------------------------------------------+   |
|   |  Layout tree  (the Terminator idea)                 |   |
|   |    Node = Split(H|V, [children], ratios)            |   |
|   |         | Tabs([children], active)                  |   |
|   |         | Leaf(Pane)                                |   |
|   +-----------------------------------------------------+   |
|                        |                                    |
|              each Leaf owns a Pane:                         |
|   +-----------------------------------------------------+   |
|   |  Pane = { Term (alacritty_terminal), PTY, title,    |   |
|   |           group, scrollback viewport }              |   |
|   +-----------------------------------------------------+   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Engine layer:** depend on `alacritty_terminal` (grid, parser, PTY via its
  `tty` module) rather than rewriting it. Pin the version we vendored.
- **Layout layer:** our own recursive tree — this is the port of Terminator's
  `paned.py` / `notebook.py` / `container.py`, but as a pure data structure
  (no widget reparenting → avoids Terminator's whole class of use-after-free
  reparenting crashes; see `docs/TERMINATOR_BUGS.md`).
- **Render layer:** one GPU surface for the whole window; we blit each pane's
  visible grid into its rectangle. Modeled on alacritty's renderer but
  multi-viewport.
- **Input layer:** keybinding table (port of `keybindings.py`) + broadcast
  groups (port of Terminator's grouping) routing bytes to one or many PTYs.

Rationale for reusing `alacritty_terminal` instead of GTK VTE: it removes the
GTK main-loop reentrancy that is the suspected source of Terminator's random
crashes, and it is measurably faster at parsing throughput.

### ADR-0002 (session 1 user decisions)
- **Renderer:** winit + **OpenGL**, mirroring alacritty's GPU glyph-atlas
  renderer for maximum speed (chosen over a simpler CPU/softbuffer path). Cost:
  heavier native deps (GL/EGL) that make aarch64/rv64 cross-compiles harder —
  handled in M6 via per-arch containers.
- **Sequencing:** *features first*. Build the runnable Terminator-UX binary
  (splits, tabs, focus nav, broadcast, keybindings) before the packaging matrix.
- The feature/controller logic (`rt-session`) is written as pure, headless-
  testable code so it is verifiable in CI even though the GL window is not.

### ADR-0003 (session 1 user decision) — Wayland-native
- rt is **Wayland-only**. No X11, no XWayland fallback. winit is built with only
  the `wayland`+`wayland-dlopen` backend and glutin/glutin-winit with only
  `egl`+`wayland` (defaults disabled, since they re-add glx/x11). Verified: the
  dependency tree contains zero `x11`/`xcb`/`glx` crates, and the binary
  launches with `DISPLAY` unset using only `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`.

## 4. Milestones

### M0 — Bootstrap  ☑
- ☑ Create `~/git/rt`, confirm GitHub remote (`git-rt`).
- ☑ Clone terminator + alacritty into `reference/` (gitignored).
- ☑ Probe toolchain (rustc 1.95, cargo, docker, podman present; rpmbuild,
  cargo-deb, cargo-generate-rpm, cross, makepkg NOT present → install later).
- ☑ Write `.gitignore`, `PLAN.md`.
- ☑ Write `docs/` (PORTING_LOG, REFERENCES, TERMINATOR_BUGS). ARCHITECTURE
  folded into PLAN.md §2 for now.
- ☑ Commit M0 and push. (commit: bootstrap)

### M1 — Critical analysis of Terminator  ☑
- ☑ Bug-hunt subagent found + we verified THE random-crash bug: `cwd.py:15-20`
  unguarded `psutil` cwd probe on a dead pid.
- ☑ Findings written to `docs/TERMINATOR_BUGS.md` with rt's design mitigations.

### M2 — Cargo skeleton  ◐
- ☑ Workspace `Cargo.toml` (release profile mirrors alacritty).
- ☑ `rt-core`: layout tree (splits/tabs/close-collapse/rects/spatial nav) with
  9 headless integration tests, all green.
- ☐ Remaining crates (`rt-engine`, `rt-render`, `rt-config`, `rt`) added as
  their milestones land.
- ☑ Commit + push (this milestone).

### M3 — Engine wrapper  ☐
- ☐ `rt-engine`: spawn a PTY, run a shell, feed bytes to an
  `alacritty_terminal::Term`, expose a renderable grid snapshot.
- ☐ Headless integration test: run `echo hi`, assert grid contents.

### M4 — Renderer + window  ◐  (single-pane VISUALLY VERIFIED)
- ☑ `rt` binary: winit `ApplicationHandler` + glutin(EGL/Wayland) context +
  glow GL renderer with a `fontdue` glyph atlas (single shader; opaque seed
  texel doubles for solid fills). Draws each pane's grid + focus border.
- ☑ Wayland-native (ADR-0003): X11 fully removed from the dependency tree.
- ☑ **Visually verified**: launched against the live Wayland display, captured
  the window — the bash prompt renders through the atlas with the blue focus
  border. See `docs/screenshots/first-light.png`.
- ☐ Multi-pane visual check (split rendering); cursor block; colours/attrs from
  the grid (currently one fg colour); tab strip drawing.

### M5b — Newspaper columns (rt-original feature)  ◐  (VISUALLY VERIFIED)
- ☑ Engine seam: history-aware `snapshot_lines(top,rows)` + `line_bounds()` +
  `is_alt_screen()`. Tested (`rt-engine/tests/history.rs`).
- ☑ Session seam: per-pane column count + `column_layout()` + column scroll;
  column-aware `relayout` sizes the PTY to one column. Tested.
- ☑ Config: `ColumnsMore`/`ColumnsFewer` actions, `Ctrl+.`/`Ctrl+,` bindings.
- ☑ Renderer: column-major layout of `N×rows` lines + separators + wheel scroll
  + alt-screen fallback. **Verified**: `docs/screenshots/newspaper-columns.png`
  (3 cols, `seq 1 200` flows 139→140, 170→171). See `docs/COLUMNS.md`.
- ☐ Scroll indicator; auto-snap-to-bottom; selection across columns.

### M5 — Terminator features  ◐  (controller logic done + tested; GL wiring next)
- ☑ Keybinding config parse (`rt-config`): Terminator accelerator syntax +
  default map + `Action` enum. 6 tests.
- ☑ Controller (`rt-session`): splits (Ctrl+Shift+O→TopBottom, E→LeftRight),
  new tab, close+refocus+collapse, spatial focus nav, broadcast Off/Group/All
  input fan-out, relayout/resize. Generic over a `Backend` trait so it is
  tested headless with a mock (8 tests). Real `rt_engine::TermPane` bridges in.
- ☐ Saved layouts (serialise the tree). Tab cycling (needs a tree tab API).
- ☐ Wire the controller into the GL binary + physical-key → `Chord` mapping.

### M6 — Packaging matrix  ☐  (3 formats × 3 arches = 9 artifacts)
Formats: **.deb**, **.rpm**, **arch** (`.pkg.tar.zst`).
Arches: **x86_64**, **aarch64**, **riscv64gc** (rv64).
- ☐ Install `cargo-deb`, `cargo-generate-rpm` (no root needed; they emit the
  archives directly without dpkg/rpmbuild).
- ☐ `cargo-deb` metadata in `crates/rt/Cargo.toml`.
- ☐ `cargo-generate-rpm` metadata.
- ☐ `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD`.
- ☐ Cross-compile targets: add rustup targets; use `cross` (docker) for
  aarch64/riscv64 because of native GUI deps.
- ⚠ **Known hard:** cross-compiling a GPU/winit GUI to riscv64 pulls in
  X11/Wayland/GL system libs. Fallback plan documented in
  `packaging/README.md`: build in per-arch containers via podman/qemu, or ship
  rv64 as source/AUR only if binary cross fails. Document whatever we achieve.

### M7 — Polish & docs  ☐
- ☐ README, man page, screenshots, CHANGELOG.
- ☐ Final commit + push + tag.

## 5. Coding standards (hard requirement from the user)
- **Every Rust function** gets a `///` or `//` block comment explaining what it
  does, its params, returns, and failure modes — in detail.
- **Every non-trivial line** gets an inline `//` comment explaining it.
- Trivial lines (`}`, obvious `let x = 5;`) may be left uncommented.
- This is verified by eye during review; keep it consistent from line 1.

## 6. How to resume after a crash
1. `cd ~/git/rt && git log --oneline -5` — see last committed state.
2. Read this `PLAN.md` status markers + tail `docs/PORTING_LOG.md`.
3. If `reference/` is missing, re-run the clones in `docs/REFERENCES.md`.
4. Continue at the first ◐/☐ milestone.
